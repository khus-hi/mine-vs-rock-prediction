# mine-vs-rock-prediction
A "Mine vs Rock" prediction task is a binary classification problem in which the goal is to identify whether a sonar signal is bouncing off a mine (potentially dangerous, like an underwater explosive) or a rock (harmless object). 

**Overview:**

This project aims to classify sonar signals as either Mine or Rock using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains 60 features representing sonar energy readings at various frequencies. Each instance is labeled as either 'M' (Mine) or 'R' (Rock).

Instances: 208

Features: 60 numerical attributes (float values)

**Target Variable:**

M = Mine

R = Rock

**Objective:**

To build a robust classification model that can accurately distinguish between sonar signals reflected by mines and those reflected by rocks.
